//1.Listen, understand the problem
//2.Example, normal small case, special case(empty string/special chars?), big enough case,
//3.Brute force way(naive way)...for each char, check if the same char exists in the rest of string,check the time complexity, don't code yet since it is not final version.
//4.BUD optimization. 
//	  a: look for unused info.
//	  b: Use a fresh example.
//	  c: Solve it "incorretly" will provide negative result to think it over
//	  d: Make time vs space tradeoff. More space may save more runtime.
//	  e: Precompute information. Sorting/compute value upfront save time in the   long run.
//	  f: Use hash table
//	  g: Think about the best conceivable runtime
//5.Walk Through the optimal solution found, not code yet...solidify my understanding of algorithm. Write code slowly and get a feel for the structure of the code. Know what the variables are and when they change.
//6.Implement. Write beautiful code. 
//	 a: Modularized code. write functions pretending the function is there, fill in details later if need to.
//   b: Error checks.
//.  c: Use classes/structs if necessary (e.g. returning object)
//.  d: Good varaible name. it is OK to use abbreviation.
//.  e: Just write beautiful code (need to practice)
//7.Test. 
//	a: Conceptual test. reading and analyzing each line, does the code do what you think it does?
//	b:Weird looking code. Double check the line of code that is weird.
//	c:Hot spots. know wht things are likely to cause problem. recursive code. Integer division, Null nodes in binary trees. The start and end of iteration throught liked list.
//	d:Small test cases.
//	e:Special cases. Test against null or single element values, extreme cases, etc.
//	f:When finding bugs, analyze the bug and make correction in the best place.
